# ChatApplication-Server
C# secure chat server application

# About

This is the server component that relays messages between clients as well as storing the timestamps of all clients in a database to update clients that were offline.

# Usage

It is strongly recommended not to use this system for messaging as it is only a demonstration, however examining the project is perfectly acceptable. Create a directory called ChatApplication-Server, use git clone, copy and paste files into directory and delete .git folder, then copy the files under the database directory to C:\ChatAppServer
